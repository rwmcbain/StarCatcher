# StarCatcher






### Game Summary

* Star Catcher is a game where you control a character and go around collecting stars before
the timer runs out(25s). You can replay as many times as you'd like to try to beat your time!


### Approach

* I was inspired by the old browser game 'Monkey Maze'. I wanted to create a game that emulated games
from the 80's with 8bit-ish graphics. I used the Phaser framework to create this game and also used
vanilla javascript to perform functions outside of Phaser.


### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Render a game in the browser**
* **Switch turns** between two players (Game is ONE player only)
* **Design logic for winning** & **visually display which player won**
* **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
* Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles
* Use **Javascript or jQuery** for **DOM manipulation**
* **Deploy your game online**, where the rest of the world can access it
* Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working game, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working game** in the URL section of your Github repo. This must be placed inside of `your_username.github.io` in a folder called `project1`. It will then be accessible via http://your_username.github.io/project1/
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project. We strongly encourage you to work our of the repository `your_username.github.io`
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
